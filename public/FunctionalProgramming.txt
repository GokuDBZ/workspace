Functional Programming:-

> Functional programming is about writing pure functions, about removing hidden inputs and outputs as far as we can, 
so that as much of our code as possible just describes a relationship between inputs and outputs.

Pure functions are those which dont have any hidden input and output.

public void processNext() {
    Message message = InboxQueue.popMessage();

    if (message != null) {
        process(message);
    }
}---------------------------   Above method has " message" as hidden input and process(message) gives hidden output of which we are not aware of.
